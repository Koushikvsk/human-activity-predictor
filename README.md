Overview
This project is focused on classifying human activities using sensor data, such as data from accelerometers and gyroscopes. Several machine learning models are evaluated to determine the most effective approach.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains sensor readings for multiple human activities. Each row in the dataset represents sensor readings and the corresponding activity label.

Sensor Data: Accelerometer, Gyroscope
Activities: Walking, Running, Standing, etc.
Dependencies
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn

Project Structure
human-activity.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis and model training process.
data/: Directory containing the dataset files.
models/: Saved models for comparison.
README.md: Project documentation.
Models Used
The following machine learning models were tested:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Results
The model performances were evaluated using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report. The best performing model achieved an accuracy of X% (this can be filled after running your notebook).
